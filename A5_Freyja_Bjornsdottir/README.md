#### Comments, assignment 5
Remember not to mix classes and instance variables. You can keep track on this by always remembering to name the instance variable in lowercase.
```
private ClockInterface clockInteface;

public ClockThread(ClockInterface clockInterface) {
	this.clockInterface = clockInterface;
}
```
Otherwise you are on the right track. Start with the things you find easier, for example designing a nice GUI, and get together in a study group for the rest.
